## Enhanced Edition

This version uses a build process with tq-bundler: https://github.com/scambier/TQ-Bundler

Run `make build` to create the finalized build.fnl file for code.

Run `make watch` to set up a watcher that rebuilds the build.fnl file and loads it into Tic80 (assumed to be on Mac installed in /Applications/)
